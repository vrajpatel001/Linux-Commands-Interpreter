### Vraj Patel - 19BEC100

#### I am trying to make my own version of Linux commands interpreter using python.

##### Currently I have written code for this commands:
- cd
- pwd
- ls
- cal
- date
- whoami
- exit

###### *Code for all varients and flag operations are not yet written.

##### In 'cd', the commands supported are:
- cd [Relative path]    
- cd ["Absolute path"]
- cd
- cd ~
- cd ..
- If there is space in between the directory name (Vraj Patel) then use "cd Vraj\ Patel"

###### *[] used just to give example

#### Terminal Emulator shows "Username@Hostname::CurrentDirectory>" Works inside the cmd

##### I am planning to include all the basic commands and some of the flag operations.

##### I am sending the current version as .exe so that you can also check on your windows machine.

##### When you download click on download anyway in google drive and when you run it and some dialog box appears click on more info and then run anyway.

##### Thank you for your time!!
